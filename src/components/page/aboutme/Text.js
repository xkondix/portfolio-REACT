      Hello everybody,
      My name is Konrad and i'm a student of Computer Science in the 7th semester. To start of with I would like to tell you a bit about myself. I was a footballer for 12 years as it was/still is one of my passions. Being a footballer taught me discipline, regularity and self-denial. Due to the experiences I've previously had I can look to develop my knowledge by taking small steps every day, as in the book "The Slide Edge" written by Jeff Olson. After ending my football career the next chapter was to start high school in direction of mathematics-computer science-physics, where I started learning programming from c ++. In the meantime i had a role in the local theatre which lasted a year. Before I continued with my university work i've decided that Java is going to be my main language. I've decided to start my story with Java from a book written by Bruce Eckel called "Thinking in Java". Unfortunately while studying i had to learn python to perfection and other important subjects which did slowed down my knowledge in learning Java but taught me to learn more than one thing at once. Currently i am using all my free time to create my own projects and read IT books, the last book i read was called "Clean Code" written by Robert C Martin. To summarise my other hobbies i also like to go to the gym and sing karaoke. When it comes to my future i would like to start off with working as a junior java developer, from which i could expand my knowledge within the industry.
